<p>Terms of service
Last revised: Jan 24, 2020

Thank you for your interest in Mobike!

Please read these Terms of service carefully as they contain important information regarding your legal rights, remedies, and obligations. These include various limitations and exclusions, a clause that governs the jurisdiction and venue of disputes, except where prohibited, an agreement to arbitrate on an individual basis (unless you opt out), and obligations to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

Introduction
Turo Inc., for and on behalf of its subsidiaries (collectively, “Turo”, “we”, or “us”), provides an online car sharing platform that connects vehicle owners with travelers and locals seeking to book those vehicles. Turo is accessible online including at turo.com and as an application for mobile devices. Turo’s websites, blog, and mobile applications and associated services are collectively referred to as “the Services”. By accessing or using the Services, including by communicating with us or other Turo users, you agree to comply with, and be legally bound by, the provisions of these Terms of Service (“Terms”), whether or not you become a registered user of the Services. These Terms govern your access to and use of the Services and constitute a binding legal agreement between you and Turo.

These Terms, together with Turo’s Privacy Policy, applicable insurance terms and certificates, roadside assistance terms, and the user Policies accessible via the Services (the “Policies”) constitute the “Agreement” between you and Turo (each a “Party” and together, “the Parties”).

Modification. Turo reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to modify our Services or to modify these Terms at any time. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on our Services. We will also update the “Last Revised” date at the top of these Terms. By continuing to access or use our Services after we have posted a modification or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your sole recourse is to stop using and accessing the Services and close your Turo Account within 30 days, in which case the previous effective version of these Terms will apply to you, unless you have used the Services during the intervening 30 day period, in which case the new version of these Terms will apply to you.

If you have any questions for us concerning the Agreement, or Turo generally, please contact us at support.turo.com. Any questions related to protection plans in the United States should be directed to Turo Insurance Agency, LLC (“Turo Insurance Agency”) at claims@turo.agency or 1-415-508-0283. For all other regions, direct questions related to protection plans to support.turo.com.

General terms
Eligibility. Our Services are intended solely for persons who are 21 or older, except in the United States where we permit guests age 18 and older to book vehicles. Any use of the Services by anyone that does not meet these age requirements is expressly prohibited.

Registration. To access certain features of the Services, you must sign up for an account with us (a “Turo Account”) by either providing us your email address and creating a password or connecting through an account with a third-party site or service (including Apple, Facebook and Google).

Verification. When you list or book a vehicle, you provide us with certain information about yourself to enable us to verify your identity in order to become an “Approved Driver”. You promise to provide complete and accurate information to Turo about yourself and your vehicle(s), if applicable. Where permitted, Turo has the right, but not the obligation, to undertake screenings, checks, and processes designed to help verify or check the identities and/or backgrounds of users and vehicles, including driving history and driver’s license validity. Turo does not endorse any vehicle, user, or a user’s background, or commit to undertake any specific screening process. Turo may in its sole discretion use third party services to verify the information you provide to us and to obtain additional related information and corrections where applicable, and you hereby authorize Turo to request, receive, use, and store such information. Turo may accept or reject your application to become an Approved Driver in its sole and absolute discretion. Turo may, but does not commit to, undertake efforts to ensure the safety of vehicles shared through the Services. We do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse the safety or roadworthiness of any vehicles beyond our policies that require vehicle owners to ensure their vehicles are in safe and operable condition, legally registered to be driven on public roads, have a clean (non-salvaged/non-branded/non-washed/non-written off) title, not subject to any applicable safety recalls, and otherwise satisfy our eligibility requirements.

Consumer Report Authorization. When you apply to become an Approved Driver or at any time after where Turo reasonably believes there may be an increased level of risk associated with your Turo Account, you provide Turo with written instructions and authorization in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, applicable consumer reporting laws, or any similar laws to obtain your personal and/or business auto insurance score, credit report and/or conduct a background check, including a criminal background check where permissible under applicable law.

Ongoing Information Updates. You promise to update the information you have provided to Turo in the event of any changes to your driving record, contact information, or background. Specifically with respect to your contact information, Turo may deliver notices to you at the most recent email, telephone, or address provided by you, and those notices will be considered valid even if you no longer maintain the email account, telephone number, or receive mail at that address unless you provide updated contact information to us. Also, you are, and will be solely responsible for, all of the activity that occurs through your Turo Account, so please keep your password and Turo Account information secure. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Turo Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Turo of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Turo Account. We are not responsible for your failure to comply with this clause, or for any delay in shutting down or protecting your Turo Account after you have reported unauthorized access to us.

Your Commitments. You agree that you will always use your Turo Account and the Services in compliance with these Terms, applicable law, and any other policies and standards provided to you by Turo. As a vehicle owner or host (“host”), you commit that you will provide a safe and legally registered and insured vehicle, with a clean (non-salvage/branded/written off) title, in good mechanical condition, on time to the traveler or guest who is an Approved Driver ( “guest”) and will not list your vehicle on any other car sharing marketplace. As a guest, you commit that you’ll be a legally licensed driver and provide proof to the host of a current, valid driver’s license, who will treat the vehicle and any applicable Extras well and will take all reasonable measures to return the vehicle and any applicable Extras on time and in essentially the same condition as received. In connection with your use of or access to the Services you may not, and you agree that you will not, nor advocate, encourage, request, or assist any third party to:

Violations. Turo has the right, but not the obligation, to investigate, pursue, and seek to prosecute, litigate, or refer to law enforcement, violations of the Agreement to the fullest extent permissible by the law. Turo may access, preserve, and disclose any of your information if we are permitted or required to do so by law; if we believe in good faith that it is reasonably necessary to respond to claims asserted against Turo or to comply with permissible legal process (for example, subpoenas or warrants); to enforce or administer these Terms; to do so for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation, customer support, product development, and debugging purposes; and/or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Turo, its employees, its users, or members of the public.

Turo reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, in accordance with applicable law, to remove or disable access to any content that Turo, at its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of this Agreement, or otherwise harmful to the Services or our community. If we believe you are abusing Turo, our users, or employees in any way or violating the letter or spirit of any of this Agreement, we may, in our sole discretion and without limiting other remedies, limit, suspend, or terminate your Turo Account(s) and access to our Services, remove hosted content, deny a claim for coverage, remove and demote your listings, reduce or eliminate any discounts, and take technical and/or legal steps to prevent you from using our Services. Additionally, we reserve the right to refuse or terminate our Services to anyone for any reason at our discretion to the full extent permitted under applicable law.

Policy Enforcement. When an issue arises, we may consider the user’s performance history and the specific circumstances in applying our Policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort to do the right thing, subject to our sole and absolute discretion.

Fees; Collection of Fees. The fees we charge for using our Services and other cost structures can be found on our Policy Pages. When you provide Turo a payment method, you authorize Turo, or third-party service providers acting on Turo’s behalf, to store your payment credential for future use in the event you owe Turo any money. You authorize Turo to use stored payment credentials for balances, including for Trip Costs, payment, fines and fees (e.g., late fees, security deposits, processing fees and claims costs and related administrative fees). Turo and its partners will employ all legal methods available to collect the amounts, including the engagements of collection agencies or legal counsel. Turo, or the collection agencies we retain, may also report information about your Turo Account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your Turo Account may be reflected in your credit report. In addition to the amount due, delinquent accounts and/or chargebacks will be charged with fees and/or charges that are incidental to the collection of delinquent accounts and/or chargebacks including, but not limited to, collection fees, convenience fees, and/or other third party charges. You hereby explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts may be made by e-mail or phone, as provided to Turo by you. Such communication may be made by Turo or by anyone on its behalf, including but not limited to a third-party collection agent. If you wish to dispute the information Turo reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion) please contact support.turo.com. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau regarding your Turo Account, you must contact the collection agency directly. Any use of referral travel credit is governed by the terms and conditions outlined in this policy.

Communications with You. In order to contact you more efficiently, you agree that we may at times contact you using autodialed or prerecorded message calls or text messages at your telephone number(s). We may place such calls or texts primarily to confirm your signup; provide notices regarding your Turo Account or Turo Account activity; investigate or prevent fraud; collect a debt owed to us; or communicate urgent messages. We may share your phone number(s) with service providers with whom we contract to assist us in pursuing these interests. We will not share your phone number(s) with third parties for their own purposes without your consent. Standard telephone minute and text and data charges may apply. Where Turo is required to obtain your consent for such communications, you may choose to revoke your consent.

You authorize Turo and its partners, without further notice or warning and in our discretion, to monitor or record telephone conversations you or anyone acting on your behalf has with Turo or its agents for quality control and training purposes. You acknowledge and understand that your communications with Turo may be overheard, monitored, or recorded without further notice or warning. If you do not wish to have your call recorded, please contact us instead in writing through support.turo.com.

Insurance. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the explanation of insurance coverage in these Terms and an insurance policy offered to the Turo community, the insurance policy language controls. In Canada, the applicable law regarding insurance policies are the laws of Canada and the laws of the province where the policy has been issued. For more information click here. There is no insurance or protection available via the Services outside the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, or the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec.<p>
